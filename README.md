An unofficial content creation toolkit for PDX games, specifically CK III.

TODO:
+ on actions
  + chance to happen
+ decisions
+ find dialog polish
  + add visibility binding and converter to submit button (so it turns invisible, not just transparent, when canexecute = false)
  + make opening "find" dialogs only possible, if there would be any (non-blacklisted) items
+ name rule polish
  + disallow capital letters
